  description: `I have enjoyed a long and successful career in Infrastructure Engineering. Designing, implementing and maintaining mission critical communications infrastructure.

At this point in my career, I feel that I can contribute more to society, by passing my skills to others. Hence my decision to switch my development path into Education.

Having traveled the world and the seven seas, on the back of my education, I recently decided to start giving something back. I hope, by focusing my knowledge and experiance into education that I will be able to help start someones' journey.
